Email from J. Barrow on the locations of some cooked CLAS12 e4nu data
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of my code live here:
/u/home/jbarrow/e4nu/rgm

You’ll want to source the environment.csh file to get CLAS12 software (like CLAS12ROOT) up and running.

Some of my monitoring codes live here:
/u/home/jbarrow/e4nu/rgm/Macros

Particularly, you can find some updated ones there, such as:
e4nu_Comparison_byChannel_2p1GeV.C (most updated)
e4nu_Comparison_byChannel_4p03GeV.C
e4nu_Comparison_byChannel_5p98GeV.C

You can run them in a screen session over .hipo files via
clas12root -b

and then a command like
.x e4nu_Comparison_byChannel_2p1GeV.C("/volatile/clas12/rg-m/LAr/prod1.0/dst/recon/015672/rec_clas_015672.evio.*.hipo",
"/lustre19/expphy/volatile/clas12/users/jbarrow/Simulation/reconhipo/recon_qe_GENIE_Ar40_2p1GeV_HighlyRad_*_torus0.5_sol-1.0.hipo",
"Ar40_withIDs_wChi2cuts_wOmegaLT1p2_wHighRad_rgm_2p1GeV",2.07052,1.2)

…feel free to also check through my .root_history if you like.

You can see that most of that the arguments the script takes are ranges of subrun .hipo files using the * flag; most live on /volatile/clas12/rg-m.
You’ll need to consult with someone like Tyler or Andrew (or, in truth, Justin) to get a full list, as I’ve only really worked with Ar40 and C12 due
to those being the ones we have GENIE+GEMC simulations for.

The simulated files usually all live in:
/lustre19/expphy/volatile/clas12/users/jbarrow/Simulation/
 
as you can see from the script run command; there should be several nuclei and several energies there. Note that the simulation files may have a
systematic shift in their energies, as we exact beam energy (such as 2.07052 GeV) wasn’t known at run time; in principle, these can be corrected
for in most ways with a  simple shift, but this is a subleading effect.

Safer location for RGM hipo files (volatile can get deleted) 
work/clas12/rg-m/

command to convert HIPO TO ROOT
particleTree /volatile/clas12/rg-m/LAr/prod1.5/dst/recon/015723/rec_clas_015723.evio.00001.hipo testCarlos.root $CLAS12ROOT/RunRoot/Ex4_TreeMaker.C


command to convert HIPO to ROOT. The .C code can also add new branches (most importantly, chi2pid) into the ROOTfile
clas12root 'CLAS12SkimmerTree_simple.C("/volatile/clas12/rg-m/LAr/prod1.5/dst/recon/015723/rec_clas_015723.evio.00001.hipo","test_carlos.root")'

location of where the code is located
/lustre19/expphy/volatile/clas12/users/esteejus/forCarlos
