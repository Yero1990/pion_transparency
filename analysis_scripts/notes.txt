May 09 : Meeting w/ Larry
---------------------------

** Ask Rafaella about how to recover initial events from GEMC (for example from GENIE input)


** As a start to take ratios, I can get total charge from run db
(recovering events with beam time cuts will be more precise, later on -- meeting w/ Justin, Nathan and Rafaella tomorrow
to talk about fixing the scaler issue)


** Ask tracking experts, How does the calculation of chi2 vary with momentum?
Since we see a significant effect pion momentum with different chi2pid cuts? How many deg. of freedom does chi2 have?


** Kinematic Plots to make
1) ztar_elec vs phi_e   

2) dz_tar (ztar_elec-ztar_pion) vs. phi_e
(there should be a sinusoidal dependence, since dz_tar is not aligned,
when we look at opposite sector of electron, we should see a shift in the opposite direction)

3) plot Q2 vs W

Look at:
a)  (E_pion / nu) vs th_pi-q
b)  pion momentum vs th_pi-q

 ... for different bins in Q2 and W

4) We can try to simulate multi-pion reactions (in Genie) and pass it thru GEMC to see
if we can do a similar missing mass cut as in: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.242502
to exclude multi-pion events (i.e., cut out events in which pion re-scatters due to FSI)


Take ratios of:
ar40/he4 should be much less model-dependent than the ratio of ar40/d2 or c12/d2 
( we need at leas the total charge, which can be obtained from rcdb to 1st order )
