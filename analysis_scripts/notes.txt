May 09 : Meeting w/ Larry
---------------------------

** Ask Rafaella about how to recover initial events from GEMC (for example from GENIE input) Events that start at the
reaction vertex, get propagated throughout the detectors, and then reconstructed back to the target. But is the initial
thrown events recoverable? Maybe stored in a vector somewhere? 

** Ask tracking experts, How does the calculation of chi2 vary with momentum? Is there a momentum dependence in the chi2pid definition?
Since we see a significant effect pion momentum with different chi2pid cuts? How many deg. of freedom does chi2 have?

** Is it a correct interpretation to say: cutting out the tails of the chi2pid histo removes apparent "good" events in the
reconstructed track vertex-z difference between electron-hadron. These "apparently good" events might actually correspond
to other particle mis-identified as a pion which reconstruct to the same reaction vertex as the electron.
So a decrease in the reaction vertex peak might actually correspond to subtraction of mis-identified pions.

** As a start to take ratios, I can get total charge from run db
(recovering events with beam time cuts will be more precise, later on -- meeting w/ Justin, Nathan and Rafaella tomorrow
to talk about fixing the scaler issue)




** Kinematic Plots to make
1) ztar_elec vs phi_e   

2) dz_tar (ztar_elec-ztar_pion) vs. phi_e
(there should be a sinusoidal dependence, since dz_tar is not aligned,
when we look at opposite sector of electron, we should see a shift in the opposite direction)

3) plot Q2 vs W

Look at:
a)  (E_pion / nu) vs th_pi-q
b)  pion momentum vs th_pi-q

 ... for different bins in Q2 and W

4) We can try to simulate multi-pion reactions (in Genie) and pass it thru GEMC to see
if we can do a similar missing mass cut as in: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.242502
to exclude multi-pion events (i.e., cut out events in which pion re-scatters due to FSI)

Then plot the missing mass differente: MA - Mx,  where MA is the mass of the nucleus (exact number) and Mx is the
missing mass definition, to make it easier to apply a cut and plot (for a variety of targets), rather than an absolute missing mass.

Take ratios of:
ar40/he4 should be much less model-dependent than the ratio of ar40/d2 or c12/d2 
( we need at leas the total charge, which can be obtained from rcdb to 1st order )
